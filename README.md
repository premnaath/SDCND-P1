# READ ME - Self-driving cars Engineer Nanodegree - P1

## Purpose of this repo

This repo was created to hold all files related to project 1 of SDCND by Udacity.

### Project description in brief

In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road. You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip "raw-lines-example.mp4" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below.
Once you have a result that looks roughly like "raw-lines-example.mp4", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines. You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4". Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.

## Contents of this repo

This repo consists of files for project 1 in Term 1 of SDCND.

The list of files include,
- P1.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for P1 with updated code
- test_images - A folder containing test images used for evaluating the build pipeline
- test_videos - A folder containing test videos used for evaluating the build pipeline
- test_images_output - A folder containing output of test images using the built pipeline
- test_videos_output - A folder containing output of test videos using the built pipeline
- Reflection.md - A brief description of the procedure followed while building the pipeline
- process_image.py - A python file which defines a function for finding lanes on an image
- execute_module.y - A script which calls the process_image.py
- find_lanes.py - A python script which is does exactly the same processing as described by process_image.py
